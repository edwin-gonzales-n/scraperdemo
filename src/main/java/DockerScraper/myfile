Another useful trick is the while read f loop.
This example uses the case statement, which we'll cover later.
It reads from the file myfile, and for each line, tells you what language
it thinks is being used. Each line must end with a LF (newline) -
if cat myfile doesn't end with a blank line, that final line will not
be processed.
